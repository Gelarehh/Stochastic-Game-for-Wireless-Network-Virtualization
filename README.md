# Stochastic-Game-for-Wireless-Network-Virtualization

## Introduction
Wireless Network Virtualization (WNV) is a concept that can be wildly used in recent networks and facilitate a flexible and lower complexity solution for service customization. A broadband wireless network that can support various services over the same physical network is considered. The roles in the network are divided into two parts: service providers (SP) and network operators (NO). The two fundamental mechanisms which help us deal with the problem are Vickrey-Clarkeâ€“Groves (VCG) mechanism and conjectural pricing.

Each SP has a specific utility function that can be determined concerning the objectives and constraints of that SP. When the utilities are known, then NO is responsible for deciding the accessibility of the available spectrum by SPs. The NO has global information about the whole network, and it is in a perfect position to advertise conjectural prices to SPs to guide their bidding decisions. SPs bid for the network resources on behalf of the end-users. As the channel and traffic dynamics change stochastically, a stochastic game exists among SPs.
